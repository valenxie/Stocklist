# Stocklist - an IOS app to keep track of inventory

This is my Computer Science Internal Assessment for the IB diploma, the demo can be accessed at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r0M73IMhSUmwaaRUxpDdX88axSfk3lIM/view?usp=sharing

As an small business owner myself, I always had to update my stocks manually using a paper notebook that is not as convenient. My business scale is relatively small, so I was wondering if my friends who own much bigger businesses are having similar concerns. It turned out that one of them, Ms.Li, have been looking for an app that can help her to record stocks since she is selling a varied range of products and prefer to keep track of everything on her phone instead of Excel. 

Since we both have similar needs, I volunteered to develop an application that can help her to maximize efficiency by recording stocks digitally on smaller devices, with a more organized interface. She owns several devices that run iOS system, so to fill her needs, I decided to write my codes on Xcode using Swift.
